### Description - 

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

We will use Santander Bank Dataset to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features containing a large number of numeric variables to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience. The "TARGET" column is the variable to predict. It equals one for unsatisfied customers and 0 for satisfied customers.


The task is to predict the probability that each customer in the test set is an unsatisfied customer.
